To run my program:
1. start my windows server program (Project 1) - the Linux version is in progress (using windows because it allows you to use local host (127.0.0.1) the local host is automatic because I broke one of my code lines
2. start my Client game engine with example (AidanEngine) (the .exe is in the debug or release folder in the main directory) 

What it should do:

If you click the end turn button it should give a receive message and change the turn value in server 

The card in GUI should be dragable

I left the windows server bare because I intend to continue the project on a Linux server

NOTE: 

Most of this is my code - I used a 3rd party font rendering library, graphics library, .ini (config) reader, and a 3rd party Circular buffer, as well as a 3rd party image loader
(stb_image)
